DBMS Access Log Visualization
Database Management Systems provides logs about how/what queries are
requested by a client or more than one client. We aim to visualize these
information found in access log files in a cool way to make it easier to
read what is happening on the server side to System admins or any other
party who holds the interest to understand whatâ€™s going on on the DBMS
server. We will chose MYSQL as our DBMS however the system will be developed
in a way that allow further support for other different Database systems.

The result of our project will be an iPad App which provides a simple and
entreating overview about database load/status. The audience of this
application will be any party who is interested in database load/status
information. for example a system administrator can use this Application to
show his manager how the DBMS is loaded to get more resources.Hi
